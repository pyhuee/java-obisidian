Hey! This is the vault that I we write our documentation/learning/how-tos for Java. 

So, this repo is guided/was created in mind for the UIL Computer Science competition, and for people who are completely lost in Java! (like I am), so anything I learn, I'll try to document it here, and I don't know any Java!

If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork and make a PR! ([pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork))
