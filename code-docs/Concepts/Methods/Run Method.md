So where Java knows where to start looking at your code from, you need this little secret sauce
```java
public static void main(String[] args){
	//code goes here
}
```
A little shortcut if you're using IntelliJ is you can type in `psvm` and press tab, and it'll give you that.  Take a peak, and look at the video below.

`psst. the grey letters you saw, that was GitHub Copilot suggesitons, not native IntelliJ ❤️`
